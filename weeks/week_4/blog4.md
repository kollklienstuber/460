# Overview of week Four



## The assignment
The assignment for this week can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW4.html). The assignment for this week has me starting to learn ASP.NET MVC 5. I had no experience prior to this week of the subject and I found it confusing at first. However After reading through the pro asp.net book chapters 1 and 2 i began to better grasp how the controller and view work together.

## Link to code on Github
The code for this assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/kollklienstuber/460/tree/master/weeks/week_4/PartyInvites) 

## Steps I took and some code samples
I started this assignment with part three because I was a bit lost and decided to see how the book explained the subject. This helped and I ended up following through chapter three which had me creating a party invitation application that I modified in places to not be a complete duplicate of the books version. Below is some samples of the code I ended up for this as well as the output that came from it.
