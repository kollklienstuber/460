<h2>Week 3 Blog</h2>


<p>For this Third week of CS 460 the tasks <a href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW3.html">(found here)</a>
Had me learn C# which is something I have not written any code in before. In addition I started working with the Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition IDE and have not had much exposure to that either.<hr><hr>

  <br> <b>C#</b>First off I have found myself starting this assignment early. I have found a bit of time so instead of playing Rocket Leauge or re watching IASIP I've gone the more productive route and started early. My first challenge though is that I wasn't completely sure what the visual studio .gitignore file looks like so I just found one on Google that seemed to make less clutter after I <code>git . add -> git . status </code> I first started by watching<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lisiwUZJXqQ&t=1580s">this video</a> on Youtube to get a nice condensed but accurate and useful overview of the C# lanugage. After the Video I opened up the java version of the calculator and started working on replicating it with C#.
