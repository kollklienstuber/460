##Steps 


First off I created a new project in visusal studio 

file -> new project -> asp.net web application and named it HW8.

I created it by having the MVC icon highlighted in order to have a few automattically created pages.

Once My project was created I went in and right clicked my app data folder and added a new sql server database called artWork. This created artWork.mdf and artWork_log.ldf in my app_data folder and gave me an initial database to work with.

I then want to go in and double click my artWork.mdf file to open up the server explorer where I can then right click on my database "artWork" and select new query. This opens up a new tab named SQLQuery1.sql which i will eventually save and rename to be my up and down.sql. 

I am wanting to first create the up and down .sql in order to initiate the types of data that will be in the database. 

TO do this In the query that comes up when I double click my database and then select new query on it, i want to save the query as up.sql but I want to save it into my same folder that my project "hw8"'s database "artWork" is saved into. which is the appdata file and more specifically, this folder, "C:\Users\kklie_000\Desktop\460_git\weeks\week_8\hw8\hw8\App_Data"

However once I add the file it will not show up and isn't added to my solution explorer until I right click my app data folder and add new item and then go and double click my up.sql file in my appData folder that I had recently created.
