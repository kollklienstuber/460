Overview
</h1>
============
After the end of this second week I feel much more confident with a variety of languages. I learned and gained a much better understanding of jQuery, JavaScript, Using Api's to get data to a webpage, and a large amount of different common problems that I will probably run into again in the future. 


The assignment
============
The assignment for this week can be found (here) and what it was asking for was essentially to use jQuery and Javascript on a webpage and make it do something of value. Coming up with something to make that I was able to follow through with ended up being my biggest challenge for this week and in the end, I was not able to get my first idea to work out. I initially was trying to work with an API from Google that supplied a pie chart and the user was supposed to be able to input data into the pie chart and have the information change. However this didn't work out for a variety of issues that I ran into. I did still learn a large amount from it. I ended up changing ideas to a more simple shopping list. I also added in the weather for monmouth because I felt that adding it in would be something to add a bit more to the page. 


Steps I took and some code samples
============
After I decided on switching over to a more simple shopping list and weather info I started by reading into jQuery and Javascript. I used W3 schools as a primary reasource and started off by trying to add a form text box form element that asked for the users name and then used JavaScript to output a brief message with the persons name to the screen. The code and an example image for this is below. 

    
<script>
//this is the initial asks for name thing
function askName(){
    var name = prompt("Whats your name?");
    var message = "Hello " + name + ", if you would like to view the weather click show!"
    document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = message;
};

</script>






Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils
